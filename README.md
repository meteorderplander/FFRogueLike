# FFRogueLike

A Final Fantasy Roguelike in C#



This "game" is more like a concept in progress.  Right now it is very, very simplistic.



You can pick your hero's name, choose a job from the FFXIV job list and move around the map.  Bump into monsters to attack them. Every 10 levels is an NM that is much harder to kill than the average monster.   That's about it.



As of right now there is no way to "win" the game and the game also does not remember the layouts of floors.  So if you go to floor 2 and go back to floor 1 it will generate a whole new floor 1 for you to explore.



If anyone wants to take this framework and expand upon it feel free.  I may or may not continue adding things over time to it.



If you want to try the game without compiling it yourself (on Windows) just download everything in the /bin/ folder and run the .exe file.
